### Learning

The DigitalGov University has an **[Introduction to HTTPS for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2GmcPYWm5k)**, led by Eric Mill and Gray Brooks from the General Services Administration. This introduction runs a little over an hour, and covers how HTTP and the web work, what HTTPS does to help, and [why we should use it for everything](/everything/).

### Tools

* [`ssllabs-scan`](https://github.com/ssllabs/ssllabs-scan) - Command line tool for the API for [SSL Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/), a universally referenced HTTPS evaluation and grading tool for public-facing websites.
* [`site-inspector`](https://github.com/benbalter/site-inspector) - Scan a domain for various web/HTTP-related properties, including HTTPS support.
* [`mixed-content-scan`](https://github.com/bramus/mixed-content-scan) - Command line tool for walking over a website and scanning for the use of insecure resources.

### SSL - Secure Sockets Layer: a cryptographic protocol providing secure client-server communications. It precedes TLS and is no longer recommended for actual use due to insufficient security.

### TLS - Transport Layer Security: a cryptographic protocol that succeeded SSL. It is often used synonymously with SSL, although it is the newer and more secure version.

### HTTP - Hypertext Transport Protocol: the application protocol used to exchange information on the Web.

### HTTPS - Hypertext Transport Protocol Secure: a secure version of the HTTP protocol that exchanges HTTP messages over a SSL/TLS connection.

### CA - Certificate Authority: an entity that issues digital certificates used to certify ownership of a public key. Web browsers are configured with a set of SSL CAs which form the trust anchors from which a chain of trust can be derived.

### HSTS - HTTP Strict Transport Security: a web security mechanism that uses a HTTP response header to indicate that future visits to a hostname must use HTTPS, thereby preventing downgrade attacks.
